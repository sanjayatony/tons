On the 4th of September 2021, Kamen Rider Fourze is 10 years old. While this series aired, I was also in the middle of
my first real job as a web developer. This reminds me of how I typed in a Notepad++, listened to Winamp, and of course
my HP V3000 with a fan that sounds like a MotoGP race.

## Kamen Rider Fourze

The image above was the avatar/dummy image I always used as a test upload image. He is Kisaragi Gentaro a high school
student who becomes Kamen Fourze, a rocket-themed Kamen Rider. You can see it from its head. It looks like a rocket.

Kisaragi itself dressed like a delinquent high schooler, similar to boys in Suzuran high school. Mini gakuran, baggy
pants, and weird shiny hair. I bought a gakuran like him at that time. And don't forget that Chuck Taylor Flame. When I
am in high school, the price for the shoes was IDR 199.000 (CMIIW), right now it's above 1 million.

The series is good, and I watched it until the end.

## Web Dev

I&nbsp;joined this company, initialized with WWX, because I passed the coding test. The coding test was to build CRUD
using PHP + HTML +MySQL. At that time this company was anti-CMS and anti-framework, so we built our own CMS. I just
checked the website, it's using WordPress now. Yes, anyone can change.

I am quite happy with my job. It's a part-time job, 4 hours a day, Monday ‚Äì Saturday. Yes, I still working on Saturday.
The salary was big enough for a first-timer like me at that time. I work part-time because I also managed a game center.
Guess what the name of my game center is?
It's&nbsp;[Henshin](https://web.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1302530363518&set=t.1286635892&type=3)&nbsp;ü§£.

The logo is a silhouette of Kotaro Minami‚Äôs&nbsp;*henshin*&nbsp;pose. "Henshin" and he becomes Kamen Rider Black.

The project that I can remember and still can access is&nbsp;[Invest Bali](https://www.investbali.com/). Why I can
remember this but not the others? Because I saved the proposal. The boss accidentally cc-ed me, so yeah. That proposal
is still my reference if I am going to create one. And that proposal also opened my eyes that a website can be that
expensive. If you checked the URL of the website it's so ugly. Because it still uses variables in the URL. Bye-bye SEO.
The login to the admin page is kinda inspired by WordPress üòÖ.

And this is the era where the&nbsp;*table tag*&nbsp;is still in the layout system. Pain in the ass to fix things in that
layout.

Talking about WordPress, at the same time my other fellow web
devs,&nbsp;[Junes](https://twitter.com/mdjun_),
om&nbsp;[Saylow](https://twitter.com/saylow),&nbsp;[Prima](https://twitter.com/anima) already
using WordPress and Drupal. I remember they work for Water and Stone. This company was quite famous and the salary is
quite big. I knew because once I saw the vacancy ad.

Once, I asked the senior dev why we are not using WordPress or any other CMS. He said he was afraid that something we
need is not available in WordPress (plugin). I told Junes and om Saylow about that and their answer changes my mindset a
bit.

**‚ÄúWhy not build your own (plugin)?‚Äù**
**‚ÄúWhy reinvent the wheels?‚Äù**.

(It's funny how I remember this conversation)

Of course, at that time I don't quite understand how and I only knew WordPress is just a CMS to build a blog. I have no
idea how. I still don't get the big picture. My knowledge is far from&nbsp;*custom post type*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*custom
field&nbsp;*which is the key to everything. I feel left out but the show must go on.

My editor at that time
was&nbsp;[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)&nbsp;and[CodeLosbter](https://www.codelobster.com/).
I am already happy with the colorized editor at that time, no fancy stuff like sliding terminal, prettier, like
nowadays. Just pure editor. And my fellow web devs mentioned above were
using&nbsp;[Coda](https://panic.com/coda/). You can see a lot of gaps
there üòÖ.

I listen to a lot of music while working back then
using&nbsp;[Winamp](https://www.winamp.com/). I listen to it using
Sennheiser MX-something. The memories will come when I listen to&nbsp;[Queen ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Stop Me
Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM),&nbsp;[Coldplay ‚Äì
Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G4isv_Fylg),&nbsp;[Eminem ‚Äì
Space Bound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JByDbPn6A1o),&nbsp;[AC/DC ‚Äì
Highway to
Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l482T0yNkeo),&nbsp;[Selena Gomez ‚Äì
Love You Like a Love
Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgT_us6AsDg),&nbsp;[Nosstress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AujwXZUsi3I),&nbsp;[Dialog
Dini Hari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm6rLkbhZdM), etc. And it
perfectly represents what I felt at that time.

#### **When I am in the mood and all of the tasks are easy (Queen).**

*I'm a shooting star leaping through the sk*y
*Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity*
*I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva*
*I'm gonna go, go, go*
*There's no stopping me*

#### **When the task looks like it's impossible to solve (Nosstress).**

*Semua cerita dalam setiap hidup takkan selamanya indah
Takkan selamanya buruk
Coba selalu hadapi*

#### **When personal feelings get involved (Eminem).**

*I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you*

Now, I am still doing these web dev things and I (still) love it!
